# Overview

The past few weeks I have been becoming more familiar with cloud databases. So far, I have been recreated a generic restaurant database that Google Firebase provided a [tutorial](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firestore-web#0) for. It helped me to troubleshoot a few concepts that I was having trouble understanding and implementing.

In the coming weeks I plan to follow the basic template of this code in order to create a database of the restuarants in Rexburg that will be able to be sorted according to location, cuisine, and ratings.
